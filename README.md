# angular2-playground

This project is based on [Angular 2 Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/). Here are the points modified :
* separating the original `ts` files and the generated `js` files
* a router is added
* Re-grouping the files by components for isolating feature area modules

A todo list is added. We can add an item, edit an item, and remove an item.

Lauch App with `npm start`, a page with url `http://localhost:3000/` will be opened.

## Todos
* unit test
* live demo
